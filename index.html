                                    <p class="story-text">There once was a princess of Castile named Isabella, fearless, adventurous, and entirely unfazed by the nonsense of the world. She had one mission in life: to find THE UNIFICATION. What was it? Nobody really knew. It was far too abstract, too liquid, too slippery for any normal mind to grasp… but Isabella wasn’t normal, so she went searching anyway. She looked everywhere. In China. In (yet to bediscovered) America, yes, she actually found it first, but then Columbus, that Jewish guy with a suspiciously good PR team, showed up and took all the credit. Men... am I right? Still, no Unification. But one day, Isabella finally stopped, looked around, and there it was: the Kingdom of Aragon, with a king named Tomas. What happened next? Something-something adventure, a little drama, a bit of questionable diplomacy… and then, of course, they lived happily ever after. And that, is exactly how I feel celebrating your birthday today: a whole journey, unexpected discoveries, and finally, YOU, standing at the center. Happy birthday. May your year be as legendary, chaotic, and victorious as that Isabella’s search for Unification.</p>
